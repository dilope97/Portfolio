Flow Fields for AI and State Machines

In my third year at Digipen my team aimed to make an Real-Time Strategy game against a great number of enemies. For this I made the State machien structure of the engine we built as a team and designed it so the swarm had a singular state machine controlling the whole grup, iterating through each entitiy in the swarm and telling them what to do, this way we reduced the load that so many enemies would bring. I also Programmed the flow fields used to guide the neemies through the map. In the next video you'll see an example of them in action.

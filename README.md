# Project: Medicine Educational App with Unity**

Before I went to University I did a two year course on videogame development as a whole. This gave me the opportunity to do a 3 moth long internship at Plymouth, ENgland. I worked at the University of Medicine and I worked on two projects simultaneously building an educational app using Unity and revising and fixing the code of a second VR project made on Unity as well. I cannot show any of the projects because the university is the owner of them and I sign an NDA about it but I am allowed to talk about them.

The first project was a gamefied version of dental idetification, the same thing used in TV shows to identify criminals and victims. In this game some robbers had escaped an exploision and only the teeth had been recovered. The player needed to discover who had escaped and who had died by inspecting the teeth. I worked closely with a 3D artists that took care of the models and animations as well as with the dentistry department that made suggestions on how to change the app. I built the and integrated all the features myself and the app ended up being used in classes.

The second project was a VR game which needed to be updated and fixxed. They wanted the game to work with Oculus as well as fix the errors and bugs that the game already had. In this project I took care of the bigger buggs and programming issues while the models and levels were integrated by an artist.

**Flow Fields for AI and State Machines**

In my third year at Digipen my team aimed to make an Real-Time Strategy game against a great number of enemies. For this I made the State machien structure of the engine we built as a team and designed it so the swarm had a singular state machine controlling the whole grup, iterating through each entitiy in the swarm and telling them what to do, this way we reduced the load that so many enemies would bring. I also Programmed the flow fields used to guide the neemies through the map. In the next video you'll see an example of them in action.

**A* algorithm for pathfinding**

In the same project I also programmed the A* algorithm used for the soldiers that the players would control. I had to do this with no prior knowledge of the algorithm since I didn't have any prior subject about the matter. This came with many challenges as there where barriers that could open and close (DOORS! O NO!) this meant that while any entity was moving they might need to recomputate their path if a door had closed. This was solved by making the doors close slowly and compute the paths and flowfields in a separate thread while the game was running. Within a couple of frames the computation was done but this way we wouldnt have any surprise framerate drops in less powerful PCs.
